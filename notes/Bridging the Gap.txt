Internal vs External
  Knowledge is an internal representation, a "conceptual" representation of the world.
  Experience is an external representation, a "practical" representation of the world.

  Experience is what is observe, what is identified in the world. It is "this apple on the table" or "this table" "this room" "this thing"
  Knowledge is the collected info about "every apple;" it is the generalization of all things observed.

  Experience is the data we use after the Sensors have been processed. It is a lot of information. Not all of it will be kept after sleeping.
  Knowledge is the data we use after the Experiences have been processed. It will be

(K + S -> C) + A -> E
  Context is the "current situation" the "relevant real world objects that exist"
    We know things about the world (we know how to interact with apples)
    We use our sensors to identify that we have an apple in hand.
    Context is populated by pairing knowledge with this sensor data.
  Actions have knowledge embedded in them (I need 30 cents to carry this out; I need to find an apple to buy).
  The knowledge is matched up to the context, and then the actions are applied using the context.
  This should ultimately result in more experience (what happens when I try to find an apple at the store/try to buy an apple).
  E(C(S, K), A)
    Experience is a function of Context and Action
    Context is a function of Sensors and Knowledge
