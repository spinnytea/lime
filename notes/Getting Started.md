How to Think About the Problem
==============================

TBD
For now, see OnePager.md, LM vs AI.md

If you ever get stuck thinking "How will it do X?" the answer is as simple as "How do you do X?" The answer is the same.
That is the program to make, and that is the how to think about the problem.
Reduce your actions to their most basic logic, to their most basic intuition.


What's in the Source
====================

TBD
For now, see The Five Elements.txt

planning
--------
* blueprint is the abstract idea of a plan
    * actuator is an individual action
    * serial plan is a set of plans to do one after another
    * stub is treated as an actuator with no body, and will be turned into a serial plan as needed
* planner is an entry point to kick of plan searches
    * path is used by astar to auto-build serial plans


How the Source should Flow
==========================

TBD
The equation is in Bridging the Gap.txt


How I Envision the Solution
===========================

TBD
I haven't really thought about this too much. I figured I'd just see where the source goes.
There's no api definition yet.
There's only LM Wumpus and the Spec folder as an example of how to use it.
