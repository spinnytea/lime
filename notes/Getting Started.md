TBD
For now, see OnePager.md, LM vs AI.md

If you ever get stuck thinking "How will it do X?" the answer is as simple as "How do you do X?" The answer is the same.
That is the program to make, and that is the how to think about the problem.

====================

TBD
For now, see The Five Elements.txt


How the Source should Flow
==========================

TBD
The equation is in Bridging the Gap.txt

===========================

TBD
