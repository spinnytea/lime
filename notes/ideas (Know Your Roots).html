<p>How is "build a kitchen" different than "buy a kitchen"<br />
There is a plan to "buy" vs a plan to "build"<br />
What does build mean? ((buy or make) and assemble) all the components?<br />
So, even if I don't have ALL the requirements, I still need to know that an oven is inside. Or on the floor.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>"<span style=" color: #9DBB61;">a kitchen has an oven</span>"</p>

<p>"<span style=" color: #9DBB61;">A car has wheels</span>"</p>

<p>"<span style=" color: #9DBB61;">I have a coffee</span>"</p>

<p>"<span style=" color: #9DBB61;">I have an arm</span>"</p>

<p>"<span style=" color: #9DBB61;">An engine is a hunk of metal with some tubes</span>"</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>revelation: "has" doesn't actually mean anything. It is simply an overloaded term. It makes communicating easier (less on-demand vocabulary).</p>

<p>Has just summarizes a whole host of different "relationship types." You use has because there really is only one way that <i>this can have that</i>.</p>

<p>So then, how do I resolve "requirement" dependencies. Because, a house has people, but no all the time.</p>

<p>The concept of a house (for a person) is dependent on it having a kitchen, a place to sleep, and a toilet. It is just as capable of having people inside as it is having a giraffe, but these are not required to fulfill the essence of a house.</p>

<p>Getting all philosophical, the purpose of a house is to "store" the basic necessities of it's owner; for a person, "take in energy" "expel waste" "sleep" "stay warm (not hot and not cold)"</p>

<p>But a house is also supposed to have people inside of it, so it needs to have enough room for the person. Some people also desire belongings, in which case, it needs enough space for this.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<div style=" border: 2px dashed #cccccc; background: #eeeeee; padding: 15px;">
<p><b>Agent Smith:</b> But, as you well know, appearances can be deceiving, which brings me back to the reason why we're here. We're not here because we're free. We're here because we're not free. There is no escaping reason; no denying purpose. Because as we both know, without purpose, we would not exist.</p>

<p><b>Agent Smith Clone 1:</b> It is purpose that created us.</p>

<p><b>Agent Smith Clone 2:</b> Purpose that connects us.</p>

<p><b>Agent Smith Clone 3:</b> Purpose that pulls us.</p>

<p><b>Agent Smith Clone 4:</b> That guides us.</p>

<p><b>Agent Smith Clone 5:</b> That drives us.</p>

<p><b>Agent Smith Clone 6:</b> It is purpose that defines us.</p>

<p><b>Agent Smith Clone 7:</b> Purpose that binds us.</p>

<p><b>Agent Smith:</b> We are here because of you, Mr Anderson. We're here to take from you what you tried to take from us.</p>

<p><b>Agent Smith:</b> Purpose.</p>
</div>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>In fact, this is, fitting, as the whole point of this LM is to DO something, so it ought to remember what purpose things have.</p>

<p>Remember other relationships is important so it can know what to "expect," but for this kind of planning thing...</p>

<p>But you can't just ask someone "what is the purpose of a house" ... can you? Can you trust that they have this "philosophical" answer? Or do you need to just get empirical evidence.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>It is hard to get the <b>reason why</b> something was made.</p>

<p>So, instead, we can go with <b>how are the parts arranged</b>, and that should be enough to be usable.</p>

<p>Later on, when you fund the <b>purpose</b>, you can improve on the design, on the <b>arrangement of components</b>.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>"<span style=" color: #9DBB61;">The oven is up against a wall in the kitchen.</span>"</p>

<p>"<span style=" color: #9DBB61;">The car is resting on 2 axles that have a wheel at either end.</span>"</p>

<p>"<span style=" color: #9DBB61;">I have a coffee in my hand.</span>"</p>

<p>"<span style=" color: #9DBB61;">There is an arm attached to my shoulder.</span>"</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>An "idea of something" is just the "what you want it to do/have" just the purpose (a beautiful picture; but no reference to its makeup.). Or maybe it has the components but no arrangement to them yet (a house has an oven; but where? you don't know until you witness it).</p>

<p>A "concrete idea" needs to have everything in the right place. A "concept" just needs to have the components. An idea is just the purpose. (this is all just a tentative thought).</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<hr />
<p>&#160;</p>

<p>Why? vs What?</p>

<p>How is a link between why and what.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>The purpose is why. Why does something exist? What is it supposed to do?</p>

<p>What an object is describes its components and their arrangement.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>Maybe this doesn't really need a "distinction" in the code, maybe it is something that will just fall out.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>So how do you make this relationship robust and reusable?</p>

<p>it has to be data driven</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>object -&#62; relationship -&#62; object</p>

<p>Each of these are <i>Thought</i>s, and I need to figure out how many links are needed to make this work without any question. (is a triangle enough? ... probably)</p>

<p>then the relationship needs to be defined in a robust manner, or needs to be heavily overloaded</p>

<p>the relationship needs to have a "mapping to the real world"; you need to describe "how to employ the relationship"</p>

<p>maybe its defined by giving a bunch of examples ("this is an example of A on top of B"), and have some kind of pattern matcher (maybe a SOM) that can find all the things that are the same? and created sub-categories?</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>In this way, the relationship can be used to define the purpose as well.</p>

<p>a tab -&#62; on top of -&#62; can</p>

<p>a container -&#62; for holding -&#62; liquids</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>for now, just focus on describing objects.</p>

<p>later, you can tell it to "make better ones" or "more efficient ones" ... better and more efficient all depend on what you are trying to optimize.</p>

<p>A <i>door</i> is a <span style=" color: #9DBB61;">moveable wall</span>.</p>

<p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">In a house, they tend to be <span style=" color: #8066A0;">painted wood</span>.</p>

<p>A <i>bedroom door</i> has a <span style=" color: #8066A0;">handle</span> and <span style=" color: #8066A0;">2 or 3 hinges</span>.</p>

<p>A <i>outside-facing door </i>has a <span style=" color: #8066A0;">handle</span>, can <span style=" color: #9DBB61;">lock</span>, <span style=" color: #8066A0;">2 or 3 hinges</span> and <span style=" color: #8066A0;">insulation</span>.</p>

<p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">The typical locking mechanisms used are a "key lock inside the handle" and/or a "dead bolt"</p>

<p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">Sometimes there is an <i>eye-hole</i>, a <i>knocker</i>, or an "inside only" locking mechanism (such as a chain)</p>

<p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">--</p>

<p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">Some of these doors have windows, but this reduces the amount of insulation/privacy they provide.</p>
