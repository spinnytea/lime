Learning Machine
================
(lm, lime, lemon, plum, love machine...)

Explaining the goal of this project is all about getting the terms right.
People generally assume one of two camps when you say "Artificial Intelligence".
They either think of a machine that has the spark of life and independent free will (strong AI),
or they think of what I consider to be smart algorithms that are quick at solving specialized tasks (weak AI).

I am solving neither of these.
I simply want a system that is capable of learning.

Maybe the simplest example is of that of a Neural Network. A FFBPNN boils down to a set of matrix multiplication.
If used properly, it can come to some really intricate conclusions.
But it's a one-and-done sort of thing.
Wouldn't it be cool if you could let it continue to learn in production. To train it on new examples when they become available.
To have a person critique it's work so it can improve.
That's just a taste of what I'm working on.

The best way to explain the scale of my task is to say I'm making a strong AI; that's the closest approximation.
But it's not true.
See, a hammer is a tool. It does a job. It doesn't have it's own agenda.
A print is also a tool. Slightly more complex. It prints when you tell it to, it usually stops when you hit cancel.

I'm creating a program that will carry out complex tasks, that will learn from what it does, and will improve it's performance.
It is a general problem solver. It will learn.
